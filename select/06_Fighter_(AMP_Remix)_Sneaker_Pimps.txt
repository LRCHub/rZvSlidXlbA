She's telling me she's got to believe
That she can really hear the earthquake
That she can truly feel the ground shake
On her own

She's frantic like a runaway thief
Fault lines for the cracks in the pavement
Damaging internal statements
When she's on her own

She's fighting the flames just to cool down
Riding the waves on the slowdown
She's always been a fighter
She's always been a fighter

She looks ovеr her shoulder again
Checking somеone owns the voices
No more options just hard choices
On her own

Paralyzed and powerless
Feeling speeded up and crawling
Feeling speeded up and crawling
Never hits the ground for falling
When she's on her own

She's fighting the flames just to cool down
Riding the waves on the slowdown
She's always been a fighter
She's always been a fighter

She's fighting the flames just to cool down
Riding the waves on the slowdown
She's always been a fighter
She's always been a fighter

Hopeless as the stars align
To stop her slipping into the vortex
She never really gets the context
On her own

She's breaking the spell of her outrage
Bending the bars of her own cage
She's always been a fighter
She's always been a fighter

Whatcha doin'
Whatcha doin' to my world
Whatcha doin'
Fighter

She's fighting the flames just to cool down
Riding the waves on the slowdown
She's always been a fighter
She's always been a fighter

A fighter
A fighter
A fighter
Fighter
